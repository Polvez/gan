# GAN implementations 

In this repo you can find two GAN implementations.

## Vanilla GAN
This version is implemented according to the orignally proposed GAN architecutre in the paper Generative Adversarial Nets (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1406.2661.pdf).

## DCGAN
Deep Convolutional GAN implemented according to the paper it was proposed in, called UNSUPERVISED REPRESENTATION LEARNING
WITH DEEP CONVOLUTIONAL
GENERATIVE ADVERSARIAL NETWORKS (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.06434.pdf).
